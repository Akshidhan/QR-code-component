## My process

First, I started with writing the html code for the solution. Added a section inside a div and put all the main components inside the section.

Next I started with the CSS and added the styles to the component

Finally I did the positioning for the component. I positioned it to the center even when the screen size is smaller.

I did a single version for both mobile and desktop version because the design is responsive and can be usable for both type of screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');
```


### Continued development

Can make a hover animation for the component
